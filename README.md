# Rock Paper Scissors
## Project #24 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
A JavaScript program that simulates the classic Rock Paper Scissors game. The aim of this project is to create this game using functions.

The user selects their move using the getUserChoice() function. The getComputerChoice() function selects the computer's move randomly. Both moves are the parameters of the determineWinner() function. The playGame() function puts this all together and declares who the winner is. 
## What I Learned
  - JavaScript functions fundamentals - parameters, arguments, return values
  - Arrow function syntax
